<h1>Taula data model</h1>
<p class="author">by Take Vos (2013)</p>

<p>Objects are Taula's abstraction for all data. All data in a Taula program is represented by objects or by relations
between objects.
</p>

<p>There are three different kind of objects:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Primative types.</li>
 <li>Arrays of objects.</li>
 <li>Classes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Primative types</h2>
<h3>Integer</h3>
<h3>Floating point</h3>
<h3>Vectors</h3>

<h2>Array of objects</h2>


<h2>Classes</h2>

<h2>Memory management</h2>
<p>Primatives and vectors (and classes which only contain a single primative or vector) can be held in registers and may
not be stored in memory at all. If there are not enough registers the compiler will allocate extra memory on the stack
to store these.
</p>
<p>If stack size permits, objects that are used locally will be allocated on the stack.
</p>
<p>Objects which are stored in the global namespace may be allocated statically.
</p>
<p>A dynamic sized object returned by a function must be allocated on the heap.
