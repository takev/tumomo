<h1>Tumomo - Documentation - Manifesto</h1>
<p class="author">by Take Vos (2013)</p>

<p>The reason to create a new programming language was for writing a game. I wanted a high level
language with good performance. Something that functions like Python, but with the performance of
a compiled language and with multi-threading.
</p>

<h2>Compiled</h2>
<p>We now have had high level dynamic programming languages like Python, Perl and ECMAScript for
many years. These languages are very efficient for the programmer, but lack somewhat at execution speed.
</p>
<p>There have been some experiment with Jit compiling these languages like PyPy. I believe it is time
for a simular language to be completely compiled. The reasons to compile a language:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Execution performance, optimized to run on the CPU.</li>
 <li>An application is easily to install with a single executable file.</li>
 <li>Possible to create a system library which can be used from other languages using C calls.</li>
 <li>Inline assembly makes it possible to do anything, in fact it helps with being used as a system language.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Type inference</h2>
<p>Modern languages have a dynamic typing system, where the type is resolved at run time. Dynamic typing can even be done
in compiled languages, as long as all classes inherent from a single class (often named 'object'), like in Objective C.
</p>
<p>There are some compiled languages that do local type inference, for types used for variables inside a function.
These languages are often functional as they lend themselves for type inference quite well.
</p>
<p>Recently C++ added type inference to its language, which helps with declaring iterator variables for example. Still
in C++ variables need to be declared with the auto type.
</p>
<p>Full type inference is not possible to do for a language because, like the halting problem, you will need to run the
program to find out what the types are. Tumomo will use practical type inference, it will try its best and gives errors
to the programmer when types can not be inferred and the reason why. The programmer may then rewrite the program or annotate
the code with type constraints.
</p>
<p>The reasons to include type inference:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Execution performance, basic types which includes a single integer or real or vectors of integers and reals execute natively on the CPU.</li>
 <li>Reduce clutter in the source code.</li>
 <li>Source code can be annotated by the compiler to show the types a variable is assigned, to check for errors.</li>
 <li>Minimize memory size of variables.</li>
 <li>Detect if variables must be allocated dynamically, statically, on the stack or in registers.</li>
 <li>Detect if objects are accessed read-only so that objects can be passed by object, or by reference.</li>
 <li>Detect if objects are accessed by multiple threads, automatically executing alternative methods or adding locking.</li>
 <li>Detect if variables are constant, possible collapsing calculations and logic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Automatic memory management</h2>
<p>Most high level languages have automatic memory management. I do not like mark-and-sweep garbage collection as this method
has unpredictable performance implications and therefor less useful for interactive applications. Much more predictable is
reference counting, although in aggregate it cost more CPU time.
</p>
<p>However the Tumomo compiler will try its best to never put objects in dynamic memory. It will try to keep objects in registers,
on the stack and in statically allocated memory, whenever possible.
</p>

<h2>Multi threading</h2>
<p>There haven't been many programming languages which will allow multi-threading. And especially will not automatically make
object access thread-save.
</p>
<p>Because Tumomo through type inference knows a lot about the objects and how they are used, it may also be possible to figure out when
an object is accessed from multiple threads. And if these threads to read only or read-write access. Therefor it is possible
to automatically insert a read-write lock in the correct places.
</p>
<p>Next the developer can write its own specialist methods which can implement lock-free or wait-free version so automatic lock
insertion becomes disabled. Completely new classes may need to be exchanged, because these algorithms may require more memory.
