<h1>Tumomo Lexicial analysis</h1>
<p class="author">by Take Vos (2013)</p>

<p>A Tumomo program is read by a parser. Input to the parser is a stream of tokens, generated by the lexical analyser.
This chapter describes how the lexical analyzer breaks a file into tokens.

Tumomo program text is UTF-8, however due to limitations of gnu-flex only 7-bit ASCII is supported for now.

<h2>Comments</h2>
Comments are done with C++ syntax.
<ul>
 <li>a line comment starts with two slashes <strong>//</strong> and ends at the end of line.</li>
 <li>a block comment starts with slash start <strong>/*</strong> and ends at start slash <strong>*/</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Whitespace between tokens</h2>
</p>Tokens are separated byte whitespaces. Whitespace is needed between two tokens only if their concatenation could otherwise
be interpreted as a different token.
</p>

<h2>Identifiers</h2>
<pre>
identifier ::= L LD*
L          ::= "a"..."z" | "A"..."Z" | "_"
LD         ::= "a"..."z" | "A"..."Z" | "0"..."9" |  "_"
</pre>

<h3>Special Identifiers</h3>
<p>The following are special identifiers which define a particular namespace.

<pre>
self         class        global                                                 
</pre>

<h2>Literals</h2>

<h3>Integer Literal</h3>
<p>Default integers are in decimal, prefixing an integer with <strong>0b</strong>, <strong>0o</strong>, <strong>0d</strong> or
<strong>0x</strong> will change its base to: binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal.
</p>

<pre>
integer   ::= "-"? D+
            | "-"? "0b" B+
            | "-"? "0o" O+
            | "-"? "0d" D+
            | "-"? "0x" H+

B         ::= "0" | "1"
O         ::= "0"..."7"
D         ::= "0"..."9"
H         ::= "0"..."9" | "a"..."f" | "A"..."F"
</pre>

<h3>Float literal</h3>
<p>Floating point numbers are written as follows:
</p>

<pre>
float    ::= "-"? D* "." D+ E?
           | "-"? D+ "." D* E?
E        ::= "E" "-"? D+
</pre>

<h3>Assembly literal</h3>
A piece of assembly is started with three open braces <strong>{{{</strong> and ends in three close braces <strong>}}}</strong>.</li>
<pre>
assembly ::= "{{{" byte* "}}}"
</pre>

<h3>String literal</h3>
<pre>
string   ::= "r"? "\"" byte* "\""
</pre>

<h2>Keywords</h2>

<pre>
if           elif         else         case         do           while        for
in           break        continue     return       try          except       finally
raise        class        import       as           lambda                           
</pre>

<p><strong>class</strong> is a lexical keyword, but is also be used as a special identifier in expressions, in this case
<strong>class</strong> is converted into a identifier when creating the abstract syntax tree.
</p>
<p><strong>in</strong> is used as both a flow control keyword as a operator.
</p>


<h2>Operators</h2>
<p>The following tokens are operators:
</p>
<pre>
and          or           xor          not          in           is           isa
+            -            *            **           /            //           %
&lt;&lt;           &gt;&gt;           &amp;            |            ^            ~
&lt;            &gt;            &lt;=           &gt;=           ==           !=
</pre>

<h2>Delimiters</h2>
<p>The following tokens serve as delimiters in the grammar:
</p>
<pre>
(            )            [            ]            {            }            @  
,            :            .            ;            =            
:=           **=          //=          %%=          &lt;&lt;=          &gt;&gt;=          +=
-=           *=           /=           %=           &amp;=           |=           ^=
</pre>

<p>The period can also accur in floating-point literals.
</p>

The following characters have special meaning as part of other tokens or are otherwise significant to the lexical analyser:

<pre>
"
